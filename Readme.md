this is one stop C++ repo project specific for graph algorithms
since stl under c++ dosnt provide any specific supprot for graphs yet, so this project aims to implement graphs as adjesency lists as most widely used form.

under developement

planed phases: 
1. building basic algorithms
2. binding into package, testing individual algo for performance optimisation
3. unit tests and standerdisation
