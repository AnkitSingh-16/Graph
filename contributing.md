planed phases: 
1. building basic algorithms
2. binding into package, testing individual algo for performance optimisation
3. unit tests and standerdisation

under phase 1, we just want all graph based algorithms gathered under one hood(graphcpp folder), to be taken forward.

** only fully optimised code is expected and accepted.
